# Supabase MCP Server Compatibility Issues

## Summary of Issues

After extensive testing of the Supabase MCP server with both the custom Rust MCP client implementation (`mcp_host`) and direct process communication, we've identified these key compatibility issues:

1. **Protocol Version Mismatch**: 
   - The Supabase server reports protocol version `2024-11-05`
   - Our MCP client uses protocol version `2025-03-26`
   - While the initialize step works correctly, this version difference may affect how other commands are handled

2. **JSON-RPC Response Handling**: 
   - The Supabase MCP server is properly responding to the initialize request
   - It accepts the `notifications/initialized` notification
   - However, it appears to be hanging or not properly responding to the `tools/list` request

3. **Stream Reading Issues**:
   - Even with direct process communication outside the shared_protocol_objects library, we still have issues reading the `tools/list` response
   - This suggests a potential issue with how the response is being written by the Supabase server or a potential flaw in the read logic

4. **Timeout Handling**:
   - The timeout mechanism in the ProcessTransport implementation doesn't seem to be working correctly
   - It hangs indefinitely rather than properly timing out

## Key Differences from Python Implementation

The Python implementation that successfully communicates with the Supabase server:

1. Uses `process.stdin.write(tools_req.encode('utf-8'))` with explicit newline termination
2. Uses a stream reader approach that reads byte-by-byte and concatenates to get complete lines
3. Does not try to establish a formal JSON-RPC client but directly communicates via stdin/stdout
4. Has explicit timeout handling that allows reporting if responses are missed

## Recommended Fixes

To fix the compatibility issues:

1. **Protocol Version Handling**:
   - Add explicit support for different protocol versions in the MCP client implementation
   - Make the client understand and adapt to older protocol versions

2. **Transport Layer Fixes**:
   - Enhance the ProcessTransport implementation with better stream reading logic
   - Implement fallbacks for line-by-line reading vs. message-based reading

3. **Timeout Improvement**:
   - Enhance timeout handling to be more reliable
   - Add appropriate logging and error reporting for timeout scenarios

4. **Notification Requirements**:
   - Ensure that the `notifications/initialized` notification is sent after initialize 
   - This appears to be required by the MCP protocol but is missing in the current implementation

5. **Error Handling**:
   - Improve error handling and diagnostics in the client implementation
   - Add more detailed logging of all sent/received messages for better debugging

## Supabase Server Behavior

The Supabase MCP server:

1. Successfully responds to initialize requests
2. Accepts notifications correctly
3. Appears to have trouble with the `tools/list` request, either:
   - Not sending a response at all
   - Sending a response in a way that our client can't detect
   - Getting stuck in its own processing of the request

Without access to the internal implementation of the Supabase MCP server, we can only speculate about the exact cause, but the difference in behavior between the Python script and our Rust implementation suggests it's a client-side issue rather than a server problem.
