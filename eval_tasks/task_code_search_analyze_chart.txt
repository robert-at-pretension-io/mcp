Analyze the usage of asynchronous functions (`async def`) within a hypothetical Python project located at `/path/to/project/src`.
1. Use the `bash` tool with `grep` or `rg` (ripgrep) to find all Python files (`*.py`) within the specified directory that contain the pattern `async def`. Count the number of occurrences per file.
   Example command structure: `rg 'async def' /path/to/project/src --count-matches --type py` or equivalent `grep`.
2. Identify the top 3 files with the most `async def` functions based on the bash tool output.
3. For the file with the *most* occurrences, use the `aider` tool to analyze the complexity of its asynchronous functions. Ask `aider` to identify any potential issues like blocking calls within async functions or overly complex async logic.
4. Generate a Mermaid bar chart showing the count of `async def` functions for the top 3 files identified in step 2.
Provide the `aider` analysis summary and the Mermaid chart definition.
