Plan a 3-day trip from San Francisco (SFO) to London Heathrow (LHR) for next month.
1. Use web search (`brave_search` or `google_search`) to find potential round-trip flight options. Look for departure dates around the 15th of next month. Note down 1-2 flight options with airlines and estimated prices.
2. Use web search again to find 2-3 well-rated hotels near the city center of London (e.g., Covent Garden, Soho) for the corresponding dates. Note their names and estimated price per night.
3. Choose one flight option and one hotel. Use `scrape_url` on the hotel's booking page (if a direct link is found during search) to check for specific amenities like free Wi-Fi or breakfast.
4. Create a brief itinerary summary in markdown format, including:
    - Chosen flight details (airline, estimated price).
    - Chosen hotel details (name, estimated price per night, key amenities found).
    - Mention the search tools used.
