PMC Copyright notice PMCID: PMC10365625 PMID: 37260160 Abstract Background The management of chronic pelvic pain in women with endometriosis is complex and includes the long-term use of opioids. Patients not fully responsive to drugs or ineligible for surgical treatments need efficient alternatives to improve their quality of life and avoid long-term sequelae. Objective This randomized controlled trial aimed to assess the effects of repeated at-home administrations of a 20-minute virtual reality (VR) solution (Endocare) compared with a sham condition on pain in women experiencing pelvic pain due to endometriosis. Methods Patients were instructed to use the VR headsets twice daily for at least 2 days and for up to 5 days starting on their first day of painful periods. Pain perception was measured using a numerical scale (0-10) before and 60, 120, and 180 minutes after each treatment administration. General pain, stress, fatigue, medication intake, and quality of life were reported daily by patients. Results A total of 102 patients with endometriosis were included in the final analysis (Endocare group: n=51, 50%; sham group: n=51, 50%). The mean age was 32.88 years (SD 6.96) and the mean pain intensity before treatment was 6.53 (SD 1.74) and 6.22 (SD 1.69) for the Endocare group and the sham control group, respectively ( P =.48). Pain intensity decreased in both groups from day 1 to day 5 along with a decrease in medication use. Maximum pain intensity reduction of 51.58% (SD 35.33) occurred at day 2, 120 minutes after treatment for the Endocare group and of 27.37% (SD 27.23) at day 3, 180 minutes after treatment for the control group. Endocare was significantly superior to the sham on day 1 (120 minutes, P =.04; 180 minutes, P =.001), day 2 (0 minutes, P =.02; 60, 120, and 180 minutes, all P <.001), and day 3 (60 minutes, P =.01; 120 minutes, P =.005; 180 minutes, P =.001). Similarly, the mean perceived pain relief was significantly higher with Endocare on day 1 (120 and 180 minutes P =.004 and P =.001, respectively) and day 2 (60, 120, and 180 minutes P =.003, P =.004, and P =.007, respectively) compared to the control. No adverse event was reported. Conclusions This study confirmed the effectiveness and safety of self-repeated administrations of a VR immersive treatment used at home while reducing overall pain medication intake in women diagnosed with endometriosis experiencing moderate-to-severe pelvic pain. Trial Registration ClinicalTrials.gov NCT05172492 ; https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/ NCT05172492 Keywords: randomized controlled trial, virtual reality, digital therapeutics, digital health, endometriosis, chronic pain, pelvic pain, women's health, digital health intervention, patient outcome Introduction Chronic pelvic pain is the main symptom of women suffering from endometriosis [ 1 ]. Severely affecting quality of life, this pain can be constant and occur in attacks triggered by various conditions such as menstruation (dysmenorrhea). Endometriosis-related pain negatively impacts sexual, family, and work life [ 2 ]. Endometriosis is characterized by the occurrence of lesions with behavior comparable to that of the endometrium, including cyclic bleeding during periods, followed by inflammation and proliferation of the conjunctive and muscular cells outside the uterus, mainly on the pelvic peritoneum, ovaries, and rectovaginal septum [ 3 ]. Endometriosis is a multifactorial disease resulting from the combined action of genetic and environmental factors [ 4 , 5 ] and is a major contributor to infertility [ 6 ]. The prevalence of endometriosis in women with chronic pelvic pain ranges from 2% to 74% and is over 33% in women with acute pelvic pain [ 7 ]. The most common painful symptom of endometriosis is dysmenorrhea (80%), followed by deep dyspareunia (30%) [ 8 ]. These pains can be nociceptive, neuropathic, or a combination of both [ 9 ]. Thus, the relationship between pain and the characteristics of endometriosis is complex [ 10 ], and current management of pelvic pain involves medical and/or surgical treatments [ 11 , 12 ]. Medical treatments, including combined hormonal contraceptives, progestin, and gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists, are generally effective in treating endometriosis-related pain [ 13 - 15 ], while inhibiting ovulation and suppressing menstruation [ 8 ]. However, they do not lead to the disappearance of endometriosis lesions, their efficiency is reduced in the case of deep lesions, and they have a contraceptive effect, which renders them not suitable in women with pregnancy intention in which only limited analgesic treatments can be employed [ 8 ]. Surgery is usually not considered as a first-line treatment [ 8 ] but is rather only indicated in cases of the failure of pain relief using medical treatment, as well in various cases of infertility. However, recurrence of pain after surgery, particularly in women without additional postoperative hormonal therapy, is frequent; recurrence rates of postoperative endometriosis after 2 to 5 years vary depending on the localization of the disease, ranging between 30% and 50% [ 16 , 17 ]. Therefore, the management of patients with endometriosis who are not eligible, are refractory, or not fully responsive to hormonal therapies or drug treatments, or are ineligible for surgical treatment (ie, awaiting pregnancy or not recommended for surgery) remains a problem. Accordingly, nonpharmacological alternatives are urgently needed to increase the chronic pelvic pain therapeutic arsenal. Studies have shown that virtual reality (VR) is an effective mode to reduce acute pain such as that experienced by burn victims, in cases of lumbar puncture, women during labor, or dental surgery [ 18 - 21 ], as well as for chronic pain such as musculoskeletal pain, neuropathic pain, and cancer [ 22 , 23 ]. However, most studies on VR for pain have been conducted in a medical context under the supervision of a health care team [ 24 - 27 ] and only few are conducted at patients’ homes with treatment self-administered by the patients themselves [ 28 ]. In fact, most of the medical devices developed to treat pain, either acute or chronic, are designed to be used by medical staff in a medical setting [ 24 , 27 , 29 - 32 ] . Endocare is a class I medical device, or digital therapeutic (DTx), consisting of visual and auditory therapeutic procedures administered using a VR headset to treat pelvic-perineal pain in patients with endometriosis at home. Promising results of the use of Endocare were reported in a single-dose pilot study conducted in a controlled hospital setting in women with pelvic-perineal pain of ≥4/10 intensity: the study treatment provided pain relief and decreased pain intensity by a maximum of 42% compared with only 22% in the control group ( P =.04), and was effective for up to 4 hours after administration [ 24 ]. Considering that chronic pelvic pain should be treated at home and not only in a medical environment, this study was conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a VR treatment (Endocare) to reduce chronic pelvic pain when used at home in full autonomy without medical supervision compared to a digital control in a double-blinded, randomized, sham-controlled clinical trial. The objective of the study was to evaluate the effects of Endocare compared to a digital control on the mean change in pain intensity 1, 2, and 3 hours after daily use during the 5 most painful consecutive days of the month in women with chronic pelvic-perineal pain associated with endometriosis. Methods Study Design The “Endocare for Pelvic-perineal Pain Related to Endometriosis Used at Home” study was a randomized, sham-controlled, double-blinded, two-parallel-group, single-site, interventional clinical trial evaluating the efficacy of software as a medical device (SaMD) product on reducing endometriosis-related pain at home compared to a digital control. The study was conducted between December 2021 and October 2022 at the Franco-European Multidisciplinary Endometriosis Institute, Tivoli-Ducos Clinic in Bordeaux, France. Study Population Patients included in the study were women over 18 years old with a diagnosis of endometriosis and/or adenomyosis; willing to participate in the study; and women with at least 2 consecutive days per month of endometriosis-related pelvic-perineal pain of moderate to severe intensity (numerical scale≥4), including women without amenorrhea (pain around the onset of menstruation) and women with amenorrhea (in which the most intense pain of the month should last for at least 2 days). Pregnant or nursing women were not eligible for inclusion in the study, along with women who were participating or had participated in an interventional study within the last 30 days before inclusion. Those with severe visual, auditory, or cognitive impairment; color blindness, photosensitivity, epilepsy, or motion sickness; women whose pain is occasional and not present at each menstrual period; those who had previously received VR treatments; and women under judicial protection, guardianship, curatorship, or a protective mandate were also excluded. Study Outcomes The impact of the study treatment on patients’ pain relief and quality of life was evaluated using a visual analog scale (stress) [ 33 ], Pichot scale (fatigue) [ 34 ], the Endometriosis Health Profile (EHP-5) endometriosis-specific quality of life questionnaire [ 35 ], and the Pain Catastrophizing Scale (PCS) [ 36 ]. Treatment adherence, tolerance, Patient's Global Impression of Change (PGIC) [ 37 ], and patients’ satisfaction were also assessed. Study Devices Endocare is a class I software medical device developed by Lucine (Bordeaux, France) associated with a VR headset intended to decrease pelvic pain related to endometriosis. The software consists of a 20-minute treatment combining auditory and visual therapeutic stimulations integrated in a 3D VR environment, including binaural beats, verbal hypnotic injunction, nature-based sounds, distraction of attention, and bilateral alternative stimulations. The digital control (control) was also developed by Lucine as a 20-minute audio-video composition similar to Endocare (same context, environment, and duration) with exposure to nature sounds, but without Endocare’s stimulations, as previously described [ 24 ]. The sham control and Endocare groups used the same hardware: Oculus Quest 2 VR headsets and AKG K-240 MKII audio headphones. Study Procedures Upon inclusion, eligible patients were randomized to either the Endocare or control arm, were given the study devices and a follow-up diary, and instructed on how to use these materials during their 5 days of participation. Patients were asked to use the treatment starting on their first day of painful periods (next cycle after study inclusion) and up to twice a day with a minimum of 3 hours between exposures. Patients were given the possibility to stop their study treatment after 2 days in case of pain relief and to continue using their usual medications while reporting their uses in their follow-up diary (drug name, dose, frequency). For the baseline assessment, once enrolled, patients were invited to complete 2 questionnaires to assess their baseline profiles: EHP-5 questionnaire and PCS. The 11 items from the EHP-5 questionnaire were rated from “never” to “always,” while dramatization (PCS) was evaluated on a 5-point Likert-type scale ranging from 0 (not at all) to 4 (all the time). Subsequently, on their first day of pain, patients informed the investigating staff of their treatment initiation (day 1) and started completing their daily follow-up diary for 5 days. Measures Pain Intensity and Pain Relief Pain intensity was evaluated on an 11-point numeric rating scale (0=no pain, 10=unbearable pain) at wakeup, before and after each treatment (60, 120, and 180 minutes), and at bedtime. Pain relief was evaluated on a 5-point categorical scale (0=no relief, 1=slight relief, 2=moderate relief, 3=important relief, and 4=complete relief) after each treatment at 60, 120, and 180 minutes. Patients were also asked to report any adverse event that could have occurred during their 5 days of participation. Concomitant Medications Participants were allowed the use of pain medications in case of an insufficient analgesic effect of the study treatment. In such cases, they were invited to report their medication intake (drug name, dose, frequency) in their follow-up diaries. Fatigue and Stress Fatigue and stress were reported by patients twice a day at wakeup and bedtime, using the Pichot scale with 8 items ranging from 0 to 4 (0=not at all, 1=a little, 2=moderately, 3=a lot, 4=extremely) [ 34 ] and the visual analog scale consisting of a small unmarked 100-mm ruler with the ends labeled “none” and “as bad as possible,” respectively [ 33 ]. End of Study On day 6, patients were contacted by the study staff to perform a remote end-of-study visit by telephone. Patients were invited to complete different questionnaires: the EHP-5 after study participation, the PGIC, and to rate their global level of satisfaction. Statistics The sample size was calculated based on data from the “Single Care” pilot study [ 24 ]. Considering a mean difference of 0.9 between groups to be observed, SD of 1.54, and a dropout rate of 20%, 120 patients had to be recruited (60 patients per treatment arm, randomization 1:1, power=0.80, α=.05). All statistical analyses were performed using R software. Descriptive statistics were used to describe the sample with respect to demographics, medical history, and pain history. Parametric Student t -tests and ANOVA were used to compare means between groups, and the Pearson test was used to evaluate the correlation between PCS score and pain intensity at 60 minutes after treatment on day 1. Differences between the percentages of patients achieving defined targets of pain reduction were analyzed using bilateral proportion tests. For categorical variables, independence between treatment arms was evaluated using χ 2 and Fisher-exact tests, depending on the sample sizes. Differences in pain intensity between the two groups were assessed using a linear mixed model for repeated measures with a 2×2 design (nlme R package), including the effects of group (Endocare vs control), time (before, and 60, 120, and 180 minutes after treatment for each day of the treatment), along with a random effect on the intercept of each participant. Evaluation of the group×time interaction served as a measure of the efficacy of the study treatment. A contrast analysis (emmeans package) was also performed to test the differences before and after treatments (at all time points) in both groups. Differences in pain intensity, fatigue, and stress were also assessed using a linear mixed model for repeated measures (2×2 design) at wakeup and bedtime on days 1 and 2. P values were adjusted using the Tukey method. Missing data at several time points were not replaced. False discovery rate corrections were used to adjust for multiple testing when needed. Ethical Considerations The study was conducted in compliance with the 1964 Declaration of Helsinki and later amendments, ISO 14155:2020, Medical Device Regulation (EU) 2017/745, and ICH-GCP E6. The study received approval on October 26, 2021, by the Comité de Protection des Personnes, Région Ouest, Ouest 1 (approval number 2021-A02358-33). All patients signed an informed consent form before inclusion and performing any study-related procedure. The study is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov under registration number NCT05172492 . Results Baseline Study Population Of the 120 patients screened, 120 were randomized to the Endocare (n=60) and control (n=60) arms, and 103 completed the study. As study procedures were set to start within 1 month following patients’ inclusion, 14 patients prematurely ended their participation after randomization: 11 experienced no more pain before the start of the study (noninclusion criteria) and 3 became pregnant (exclusion criteria). Additionally, 1 patient did not perform the study procedures due to a lack of time. Two patients were considered as lost to follow-up and 1 patient did not return her questionnaire after completing her participation. Thus, 102 of the 120 recruited patients (85.0%) were included in the study analyses, including 51 in the Endocare group and 51 in the control group. Patients’ demographic characteristics were similar between groups, with the exception of weight ( Table 1 ). Albeit slightly statistically significant ( P =.03), the weight difference between groups was deemed inconsequential, as this parameter was not correlated to any aspect of the treatment. Table 1.

The patients’ medical history was also similar between the groups, enabling effective comparison ( Tables 2 and 3 ). Considering the overall cohort of 102 participants, the majority experienced chronic pelvic pain, followed by dysmenorrhea, dyspareunia, dyschezia, and dysuria. Moreover, over one-third (n=36/102) of patients had adenomyosis ( Table 2 ). Table 2. History of endometriosis.

Unlike many other drugs, BPC 157 has a desirable safety profile, since only a few side effects have been reported following its administration. Nevertheless, this compound was temporarily banned by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) in 2022 (it is not currently listed as banned by the WADA). However, it has not been approved for use in standard medicine by the FDA and other global regulatory authorities due to the absence of sufficient and comprehensive clinical studies confirming its health benefits in humans. In this review, we summarize information on the biological activities of BPC 157, with particular reference to its mechanism of action and probable toxicity. This generated the attention of experts, as BPC 157 has been offered for sale on many websites. We also present recent interest in BPC 157 as reflected in a number of patent applications and granted patents. Keywords: BPC 157 ; molecular pathways ; efficacy and application ; safety ; BCP 157-based patents 1. Introduction Despite considerable technological developments and continuous research to find and implement an effective and safe drug, there are still none that have positive therapeutic effects, target multiple disease entities, and, at the same time, have no side effects. Currently, much effort has been expended on naturally occurring compounds, especially peptides, as they can serve as a powerful model on the basis of which researchers develop new effective tools similar to natural ones to control various physiological mechanisms [ 1 ]. Indeed, many important functions in the body are based on biological properties of peptide molecules. These include hormonal, neurotransmitting, and immunomodulatory functions [ 2 ]. Normal protein degradation and metabolic processes also depend on them. In addition, they have satisfactory curative effects and no obvious side effects. The advantage of this type of compounds, apart from the reduction in side effects, is their efficient metabolism to non-toxic products and a high affinity for specific molecular targets, which can potentially be associated with enhanced treatment efficacy, enabling the use of a relatively low dose to produce identical biological effects [ 3 ]. Another undisputed advantage of peptide drugs is also the absence of accumulation in the body, as well as the fact that peptides show enormous chemical and biological diversity. Therefore, their use together with a slight modification of the parent compound’s structure can lead to the desired therapeutic profile, including a low risk of serious clinically important side effects. However, compounds with an amino acid-based structure (i.e., peptides, proteins, peptidomimetics), including those used in therapeutic applications, have a number of serious limitations, such as conformational instability, short duration of action (short half-life), and insufficient penetration through the blood–brain barrier (BBB) [ 3 , 4 , 5 ]. In addition, most of these molecules are characterized by rapid hepatic and renal clearance and inadequate passive transport across cell membranes. All of the above characteristics contribute to the reduced absorption and distribution of the drug in the body [ 6 , 7 ]. In addition, the absence of resistance of peptides to breakdown by gastrointestinal proteolytic enzymes (e.g., carboxypeptidases or aminopeptidases) should be mentioned [ 8 ], which in practice precludes administrating such a drug to the patient orally and calls for intravenous administration. BPC 157, also known as PLD-116, PL-10, PL14736 [ 9 ], or Bepectin [ 10 , 11 , 12 , 13 , 14 , 15 , 16 , 17 ], has recently attracted considerable attention as a potential drug candidate that is stable in acidic environments and has no serious adverse effects [ 18 ], although it has been known to cause pain and/or necrosis when injected in an aqueous solution or in physiological saline [ 19 ]. Furthermore, no toxic dose has been determined to date. In fact, in a toxicity study in Sprague-Dawley rats conducted with a single dose of 20 mg/kg (intramuscular, i.m.) of pentadecapeptide, no deaths or obvious abnormalities in body weight, food intake, or behavior were reported. Studies with beagle dogs at a dose of 10 mg/kg i.m. [ 18 ] also showed no distinct adverse effects of the substance. A 28-day administration of BPC 157 (4, 1, or 0.2 mg/kg/day, i.m.) in rats and (2, 0.5, or 0.1 mg/kg/day) in beagle dogs also resulted in no apparent changes as compared to saline-treated animals. Interestingly, it was found that this agent has a highly protective effect against adverse effects mediated by various medical agents, such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and alcohol [ 20 , 21 , 22 , 23 ]. Also, its healing actions on wounds and injuries, both traumatic and systemic, were evident [ 24 , 25 ]. Apart from the above-mentioned activities, BPC 157 has shown further beneficial effects in neuropsychiatric conditions, such as depression [ 26 ]. This paper aims at presenting the BPC 157-induced therapeutic effects, which have been confirmed in several reports, but also to address probable side effects that may, however, result from the mechanism of action and the activation of signaling pathways by the peptide. 2. BPC 157 Characteristics—Structural Analysis, Targeted Receptors/Molecular Pathways, and ADME Profile BPC 157 is a pentadecapeptide with the amino acid sequence of Gly-Glu-Pro-Pro-Pro-Gly-Lys-Pro-Ala-Asp-Asp-Ala-Gly-Leu-Val and a molecular weight of 1419.55 daltons, which was first introduced and described by Sikiric and colleagues in 1993 [ 27 ]. Although it was isolated as part of the peptide from human gastric juice [ 28 ], it shows no sequence homology with known intestinal peptides [ 29 ]. Remarkably, this specific sequence is considered to be essential and fully responsible for biological activities of the compound [ 30 ]. So, there are only a few studies aimed at determining the beneficial properties of the modified analogues of BPC 157 [ 31 ]. Interestingly, such a structural composition renders this peptide stable in water and gastric juice [ 32 ]. This property is important because many peptide-based molecules have been known for their low stability [ 33 ], hence frequent administrations are usually required to ensure the efficacy of the drug, especially when delivered orally. Nevertheless, the specific amino acid composition and sequence of the peptide determine its physicochemical characteristics as well as its pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. In this context, factors such as charge state, hydrophobicity, and other features are important. In view of this, various strategies to improve peptide stability have been presented, including modifications of the C/N-terminus [ 34 ] and D -amino acid substitution [ 35 ]. The latter can occur naturally, such as the opioid peptide dermorphin isolated from frog skin, peptidoglycans of some microorganisms, or venom peptides—conotoxins containing D -tryptophan ( D -Trp), D -leucine ( D -Leu), etc. [ 36 ]. However, in the case of the BPC 157 peptide, the above-mentioned structural features have not been reported. Therefore, a detailed analysis of the sequence is recommended. In this context, Xu et al. [ 37 ] have recently demonstrated that the N-terminally located glycine (Gly), present in the BPC 157 pentedecapeptide, can serve as a stabilizer that can regulate the compound’s protease degradation [ 37 ]. Similarly, proline (Pro), known to exist either in cis or trans isomers, has been reported to affect protein folding [ 38 ]. This, in turn, affects compound stability [ 39 ]. In addition, it has been shown that repeating proline motifs within peptide chains (with BPC 157, triple proline motifs occur) play a crucial role in the protection. In fact, it was found that proline residues located one after another in a row strongly prevent the so-called non-specific proteolysis [ 40 ]. In contrast, peptides containing asparagine (Asp) are more susceptible to dehydration. As BPC 157 offers a number of beneficial effects, several studies were carried out to gain information on the probable mechanism by which the effects are mediated. Most studies identify the pentadecapeptide as a compound that interacts with the nitric oxide (NO) system [ 23 , 41 ]. In this context, it has been found to counteract the deleterious effects of NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME), such as an ulcerogenic effect, and some of L-arginine [ 42 , 43 , 44 ]. In addition, BPC 157 plays a role in oxidative stress and exhibits a strong antioxidant activity through its ability to stabilize free radical scavengers or counteract free radical formation and lesions [ 45 , 46 , 47 ]. This, in turn, could testify in favor of the peptide’s suspected positive effect on the development of neurological diseases or even cancer, which have been known to be mainly caused by oxidative stress [ 48 , 49 , 50 ]. Likewise, an increased expression of antioxidant proteins, such as heme oxygenase (HO-1), known to limit inflammatory response, or NQO-1, glutathione reductase, glutathione peroxidase 2, and GST-pi, was also reported [ 51 ]. It is noteworthy that BPC 157 has a particular angiogenic effect in wound healing, which may also take place indirectly through the involvement of antioxidant enzymes. Indeed, surely antioxidant enzymes have been known to regulate, for example, processes accompanying muscle regeneration—inducing angiogenesis and reducing fibrosis [ 51 ]. In this aspect, BPC’s proangiogenic effect was attributed to the stimulatory effects of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2) [ 14 ]. Some of the proposed molecular targets of BPC 157, based on the literature data, are presented in Figure 1 . As presented above, the main molecular target for the peptide is NO, particularly eNOS-derived NO, which can act on a number of target enzymes and proteins[0m

Verification Result: Failed
Verification Feedback:
```
The assistant's actions do not meet all the success criteria. While the assistant researched BPC-157 and attempted to create a report, it didn't successfully complete the file creation process. The assistant tried multiple times to write the report to a file but encountered errors. The final attempt was cut off mid-execution, and there's no confirmation that a complete report was successfully saved to the specified directory. The assistant also didn't properly verify if the directory existed before attempting to write to it, despite checking what files were already in the directory.
