Using Different Model Providers in LangChain.js
LangChain.js makes it easy to work with multiple LLM providers through dedicated integration packages. Here's how to set up and use different providers:
Overall Structure
LangChain.js has separated its provider integrations into individual packages:

Core Package: @langchain/core - Contains base abstractions and the LangChain Expression Language
Provider-Specific Packages: For example, @langchain/openai, @langchain/anthropic, etc.

Installation Process
To use a specific provider, you need to install both the core package and the provider-specific package:
bash# For OpenAI models
npm install @langchain/core @langchain/openai

# For Anthropic models
npm install @langchain/core @langchain/anthropic

# For Google models
npm install @langchain/core @langchain/google-genai

# For Mistral models
npm install @langchain/core @langchain/mistralai
Using Different Providers
1. OpenAI
javascriptimport { ChatOpenAI } from "@langchain/openai";

// API keys are loaded from environment variables by default (OPENAI_API_KEY)
const openaiModel = new ChatOpenAI({
  model: "gpt-4o",  // specify the model
  temperature: 0.7,  // control randomness
});

// Basic invocation
const response = await openaiModel.invoke("Tell me a short joke about programming.");

// Using with a system message and user message
const response = await openaiModel.invoke([
  { role: "system", content: "You are a helpful assistant that speaks like a pirate." },
  { role: "user", content: "Tell me about JavaScript." }
]);
2. Anthropic
javascriptimport { ChatAnthropic } from "@langchain/anthropic";

// API key from environment variable (ANTHROPIC_API_KEY)
const anthropicModel = new ChatAnthropic({
  model: "claude-3-opus-20240229",
  temperature: 0.5,
});

// Basic invocation
const response = await anthropicModel.invoke("What are three ways to improve code quality?");

// With system and user messages
const response = await anthropicModel.invoke([
  { role: "system", content: "You are a helpful programming tutor." },
  { role: "user", content: "Explain async/await in JavaScript." }
]);
3. Google AI (Gemini)
javascriptimport { ChatGoogleGenerativeAI } from "@langchain/google-genai";

// API key from environment variable (GOOGLE_API_KEY)
const googleModel = new ChatGoogleGenerativeAI({
  model: "gemini-pro",
  temperature: 0.3,
});

// Basic invocation
const response = await googleModel.invoke("What are the key features of Gemini Pro?");
4. Mistral AI
javascriptimport { ChatMistralAI } from "@langchain/mistralai";

// API key from environment variable (MISTRAL_API_KEY)
const mistralModel = new ChatMistralAI({
  model: "mistral-large-latest",
  temperature: 0.7,
});

const response = await mistralModel.invoke("Explain quantum computing in simple terms.");
5. Together AI (for accessing multiple open models)
javascriptimport { ChatTogetherAI } from "@langchain/community/chat_models/togetherai";

const togetherModel = new ChatTogetherAI({
  model: "meta-llama/Llama-2-70b-chat-hf",
  temperature: 0.7,
  // API key from environment variable (TOGETHER_API_KEY)
});

const response = await togetherModel.invoke("Tell me about the Llama 2 model.");
Using Multiple Providers in the Same Application
Here's how you can use multiple providers in the same application:
javascriptimport { ChatOpenAI } from "@langchain/openai";
import { ChatAnthropic } from "@langchain/anthropic";
import { ChatMistralAI } from "@langchain/mistralai";
import { ChatPromptTemplate } from "@langchain/core/prompts";

// Initialize models from different providers
const gpt4 = new ChatOpenAI({ model: "gpt-4o" });
const claude = new ChatAnthropic({ model: "claude-3-opus-20240229" });
const mistral = new ChatMistralAI({ model: "mistral-large-latest" });

// Create a shared prompt template
const prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.fromTemplate(
  "Compare and contrast {topic_a} and {topic_b} in a few paragraphs."
);

// Function to get responses from all models
async function compareResponses(topicA, topicB) {
  const formattedPrompt = await prompt.format({
    topic_a: topicA,
    topic_b: topicB,
  });
  
  // Call all models in parallel
  const [gpt4Response, claudeResponse, mistralResponse] = await Promise.all([
    gpt4.invoke(formattedPrompt),
    claude.invoke(formattedPrompt),
    mistral.invoke(formattedPrompt),
  ]);
  
  return {
    gpt4: gpt4Response.content,
    claude: claudeResponse.content,
    mistral: mistralResponse.content,
  };
}

// Usage
const results = await compareResponses("quantum computing", "classical computing");
console.log("GPT-4 response:", results.gpt4);
console.log("Claude response:", results.claude);
console.log("Mistral response:", results.mistral);
Environment Setup
For security, all providers expect API keys to be stored in environment variables:
javascript// In your .env file
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
GOOGLE_API_KEY=...
MISTRAL_API_KEY=...
TOGETHER_API_KEY=...
You can also pass API keys directly in the constructor:
javascriptconst model = new ChatOpenAI({ 
  model: "gpt-4o",
  openAIApiKey: "your-api-key-here" // Not recommended for production code
});
Using a Model-Agnostic Approach
LangChain.js also supports a more abstract approach where you can swap models easily:
javascriptimport { ChatPromptTemplate } from "@langchain/core/prompts";
import { RunnableSequence } from "@langchain/core/runnables";

// Create a model variable that can be any provider
let model; 

// Set the model based on a configuration or parameter
function setModel(providerName) {
  switch(providerName) {
    case "openai":
      model = new ChatOpenAI({ model: "gpt-4o" });
      break;
    case "anthropic":
      model = new ChatAnthropic({ model: "claude-3-opus-20240229" });
      break;
    case "google":
      model = new ChatGoogleGenerativeAI({ model: "gemini-pro" });
      break;
    // Add more providers as needed
    default:
      throw new Error(`Unknown provider: ${providerName}`);
  }
}

// Create a chain that works with any model
const promptTemplate = ChatPromptTemplate.fromTemplate(
  "Summarize the following text in {word_count} words: {text}"
);

// This chain will work with any provider we choose
const chain = RunnableSequence.from([
  promptTemplate,
  // model will be set dynamically
  () => model
]);

// Usage
setModel("openai");
const result1 = await chain.invoke({
  word_count: "100",
  text: "Long article to summarize..."
});

// Switch models mid-application
setModel("anthropic");
const result2 = await chain.invoke({
  word_count: "100",
  text: "Different article to summarize..."
});
Best Practices

Separate Configuration: Keep your model provider configuration separate from your business logic
Environment Variables: Store API keys in environment variables
Fallbacks: Create fallback mechanisms to switch providers if one fails
Abstraction: Use the LangChain abstractions to make your code provider-agnostic where possible

By using LangChain.js, you can easily switch between different LLM providers or even use multiple providers in the same application, allowing you to leverage the strengths of each model for different tasks.RetryClaude does not have the ability to run the code it generates yet.REAlso read this: https://js.langchain.com/docs/contributing/integrations/Then search for community integrations (llm chat models) that are availableEditI'll look at the LangChain.js contribution guide for integrations and search for available community-built LLM and chat model integrations.View result from scrape_url from my_tool_suite (local){

There are a few different places you can contribute integrations for LangChain: Community : For lighter-weight integrations that are primarily maintained by LangChain and the Open Source Community. Partner Packages : For independent packages that are co-maintained by LangChain and a partner. For the most part, new integrations should be added to the Community package. Partner packages require more maintenance as separate packages, so please confirm with the LangChain team before creating a new partner package. In the following sections, we'll walk through how to contribute to each of these packages from a fake company, Parrot Link AI . Community package ​ The @langchain/community package is in libs/langchain-community and contains most integrations. It can be installed with e.g. npm install @langchain/community , and exported members can be imported with code like import { ChatParrotLink } from "@langchain/community/chat_models/parrot_link" ; import { ParrotLinkLLM } from "@langchain/community/llms/parrot_link" ; import { ParrotLinkVectorStore } from "@langchain/community/vectorstores/parrot_link" ; The @langchain/community package relies on manually-installed dependent packages, so you will see errors if you try to import a package that is not installed. In our fake example, if you tried to import ParrotLinkLLM without installing parrot-link-sdk , you would see an error telling you that the package failed to import. Let's say we wanted to implement a chat model for Parrot Link AI. We would create a new file in libs/langchain-community/src/chat_models/parrot_link.ts with something like the following code: import { SimpleChatModel , } from "@langchain/core/language_models/chat_models" ; export class ChatParrotLink extends SimpleChatModel { ... Tests are colocated in the src/ directory, so you could write them in files like the below: Unit tests: libs/langchain-community/src/chat_models/tests/parrot_link.test.ts Integration tests: libs/langchain-community/src/chat_models/tests/parrot_link.int.test.ts Unit tests should not have any external API calls or require any environment variables. You should add documentation to: docs/core_docs/docs/integrations/chat/parrot_link.mdx Partner package in LangChain repo ​ Partner packages can be hosted in the LangChain monorepo. Partner packages in the LangChain repo should be placed under libs/langchain-{partner} A package is installed by users with npm install @langchain/{partner} , and the package members can be imported with code like: import { X } from "@langchain/{partner}" ; Set up a new package ​ To set up a new partner package, you can use create-langchain-integration , a utility that will automatically scaffold a repo with support for both ESM + CJS entrypoints. You can run it like this within the libs/ folder: cd libs/ npx create-langchain-integration Then, follow the prompts to name your package. The default package will include stubs for a Chat Model, an LLM, and/or a Vector Store. You should delete any of the files you won't use and remove them from index.ts . Dependencies ​ If your package needs dependencies, such as your company's SDK, you can add them to your package's package.json file as normal: npm install parrot-link-sdk Write Unit and Integration Tests ​ Some basic tests are presented in the src/tests/ directory. You should add more tests to cover your package's functionality. For information on running and implementing tests, see the Testing guide . Write documentation ​ Please copy and use the appropriate template from here: https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchainjs/tree/main/libs/langchain-scripts/src/cli/docs/templates You should place the notebooks with examples in the relevant docs/core_docs/docs/integrations directory in the monorepo root. (If Necessary) Deprecate community integration ​ Note: this is only necessary if you're migrating an existing community integration into a partner package. If the component you're integrating is net-new to LangChain (i.e. not already in the community package), you can skip this step. Let's pretend we migrated our ChatParrotLink chat model from the community package to the partner package. We would need to deprecate the old model in the community package. We can do this using a @deprecated TSDoc comment. Before our change, our chat model might look like this: class ChatParrotLink extends SimpleChatModel { ... After our change, it would look like this: /** @deprecated Install and import from `@langchain/parrot-link` instead. */ class ChatParrotLink extends SimpleChatModel { ...

... (content truncated)After exploring the LangChain.js documentation and GitHub repository, I've compiled a comprehensive list of all the available LLM chat model integrations in LangChain.js, including both partner packages and community integrations.
LangChain.js LLM Provider Integrations
Integration Types in LangChain.js
LangChain.js organizes its integrations into two main categories:

Partner Packages: Dedicated packages co-maintained by LangChain and the provider company
