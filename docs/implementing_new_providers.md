Please analyze both the Supabase MCP server (/home/elliot/Projects/supabase-mcp) and my custom MCP client (/home/elliot/Projects/mcp/mcp_host) to determine why they're not communicating properly. The client can't load tools from the server. Investigate the protocol differences, compare the implementations (particularly JSON-RPC message handling, protocol versions, and the notification flow), and examine how each handles standard IO communication. 

The Python test script works ( /home/elliot/Projects/mcp/scripts/debug_supabase_server.py ) with the server while my Rust implementation hangs ( /home/elliot/Projects/mcp/supabase_test/src/main.rs ) after sending tools/list. This implies that there's a problem with the shared library objects.

Create a detailed technical analysis explaining the incompatibilities and provide specific code recommendations to fix the issues. To do so, please use the bash tools to do deep dives into the projects. Use all the tools at your disposal to solve this problem.
